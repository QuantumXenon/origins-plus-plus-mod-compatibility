## Origins++ Modded Support Datapack Template
This repository serves as a template for a datapack that can be used with Origins++ to add support for additional modded items not included in the base mod. 

Simply download the template and add items to the appropriate tag for seamless compatibility with other mods in your modpack or playthrough.

***

To add support for a mod in Origins++ itself, either:
- Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/pulls) adding items from the mod(s) into the relevant tags yourself (faster response time).
- Submit a mod compatability request (as an [Issue](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/issues)) and specify which mod(s) and tag(s) you would like compatibility for (slower response time).

The tags included in Origins++ itself will be updated to align with this template every time it is updated.
